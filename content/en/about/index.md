I am passionate about health data analytics, and how we can best support clinical decision making. Having done my Bachelors and Masters of Science degree in Kinesiology, I have a broad range of knowledge in various health sectors as well as the training for quantitative statistical analysis. I have created this website so I can share my data analytic projects for the purpose of personal interests as well as to continuously improve my skills in computer programming and data analytics.
