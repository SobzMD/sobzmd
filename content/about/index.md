I have been working in clinical settings for 4 years. During this time, I have come to recognize the importance of data-driven decision making, so I have continuously been honing my skills to support clinical research.

I am passionate about health data analytics and supporting all aspects of decision making in clinical settings. Having done my Bachelors and Masters of Science degrees in Kinesiology, I have a broad range of knowledge in various health sectors as well as the training for quantitative statistical analysis. I have experience in a variety of data science tools including R statistical programming software, RShiny, R dashboards, SQL, and Microsoft Excel.


I have created this website using RMarkdown Hugo so I can share my data analytic projects for the purpose of personal interests as well as to continuously improve my skills in computer programming and data analytics. See more in my [resume](/resume/).




## Hobbies

### Music

When I am not working hard at my desk you will likely see me playing music in my band.

### Travelling 

Just like exploring data, I love exploring the world on my off time.
