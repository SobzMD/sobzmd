Obesity is a chronic medical condition that affects millions of people in the United States. Obesity is associated with many metabolic diseases including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, fatty liver etc. I wanted to examine the following questions: 

* What is the prevalence of obesity by gender, age and the year in which data was collected? 

* Is Body Mass Index (BMI) a good indicator of body fat percentage as measured by the gold standard method dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)? 

* What are the differences between body fat composition between those in different weight classes?
 
By using this dashboard my hope is to create an output for visualization and analysis of the publicly available data. 

The findings of this dashboard is for the purposes of personal interests, projects and teaching only.
