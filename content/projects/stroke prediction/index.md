The purpose of this document is to:

Develop standard operating procedures (SOPs) for data analysis related projects and to create reproducible reporting. To that end the following steps were completed:

* Cleaning and visualizing publicly available dataset.

* Providing detailed distribution tables of variables of interest.

* Developing logistic regression model to predict the occurrence of stroke in the current dataset and assess it.


By using this document my hope is to create an output for visualization and analysis of the publicly available data. 

The findings of this dashboard is for the purposes of personal interests, projects and teaching only.
