The CDC estimates that about 37 million Americans are living with diabetes. It is a major risk factor for critical health events including heart attack, heart failure, kidney failure and coma. 

In this project, I was interested in determining the rates of diabetes in USA and its risk factors using multiple logistic regression analysis. 
I have taken the data from 2011-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey created a dashboard here. 

By using this RShiny dashboard my hope is to create an output for visualization and analysis of the publicly available data. 

The findings of this dashboard is for the purposes of personal interests, projects and teaching only.
